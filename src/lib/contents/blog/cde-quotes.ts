I’ve seen different numbers for the current cost of keeping a development environment working, but it’s certainly tens of percent of working time. <br/> <br /> More important, will be all the programs that folks will try writing because they are no longer afraid of wasting another 4 hours before giving up. One of those programs that wouldn’t have been started will turn out to be exceedingly valuable.“",
