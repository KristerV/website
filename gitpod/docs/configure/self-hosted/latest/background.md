# Background

> ⚠️ **Self-hosted as a product is no longer supported**
>
> The last official update of this product is the [November 2022 self-hosted release](https://www.gitpod.io/changelog/november-self-hosted-release). We no longer sell commercial self-hosted licenses. If you want to self-host Gitpod, you can still request our [free community license](https://www.gitpod.io/community-license). However, we no longer offer support or updates for it. If you are interested in an isolated, private installation of Gitpod, take a look at [Gitpod Dedicated](/dedicated).
> Read [our blog on Gitpod Dedicated](/blog/introducing-gitpod-dedicated) to learn why we made the decision to discontinue self-hosted.
