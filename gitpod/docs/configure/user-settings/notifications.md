# Email notifications

Email notifications are enabled by default.

You can modify email notification settings for the following:

1. **Onboarding guide** - In the first weeks after you sign up, we'll guide you through the product, so you can get the most out of it
1. **Changelog** - Be the first to learn about new features and overall product improvements
1. **Developer Experience & Product Tips** - Bring back joy and speed to your workflows

> **NOTE:** Disabling email notifications does not disable all emails from Gitpod. You will still receive important emails regarding account management, billing, and admin settings.
