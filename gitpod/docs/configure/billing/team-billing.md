# Team billing

> Team billing is part of [Teams & Projects](/docs/configure), currently in [Beta](/docs/help/public-roadmap/release-cycle).

> **NOTE**
> This first iteration of Team billing improves Team plans by:
>
> 1. Auto-subscribing new members when they join or leave the team.
> 2. Pro-rata billing for new members who join in the middle of a billing cycle.
>
> If you prefer to continue to manage membership of [**Team plans**](/docs/configure/billing/team-billing) manually, you can.
>
> The next iteration of Team billing will replace Team plans with [Pay-as-you-go](/docs/configure/billing/pay-as-you-go).

Team billing allows you to pay for your whole team with a single subscription. You can choose between the **Team Professional** plan, or the **Team Unleashed** plan.

With Team billing, all plan seats will be managed automatically, by auto-subscribing new members, and unsubscribing members who leave.

Team billing can be accessed under Team Settings if you are a Team owner.

Once a plan is active, Team billing will auto-subscribe new members, and the count will update automatically.

## Good to know

- A Team can only have one active Team billing plan.
- With Team billing, all team members, including owners, are auto-subscribed to the plan.
- New members are added using a shared [invite URL](/docs/configure#add-members-to-a-team) which can be reset.
- When new members join in the middle of a billing period, you will be billed pro-rata for the remaining fraction of the month.
- See [Teams & Projects](/docs/configure) to create a new Team.
