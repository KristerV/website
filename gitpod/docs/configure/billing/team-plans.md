# Team plans

> The team plans below have been superseded by our [new billing model](/docs/configure/billing).

> This page is for users who are looking to manage or cancel their existing team plans.

Team plans allow you to pay for your whole team with a single subscription.

Team plans are accessed from [gitpod.io/teams/](https://gitpod.io/teams/) in your user settings.

You can choose between the **Team Professional** plan, or the **Team Unleashed** plan, and you can specify how many seats you want for each team. Each member of the Team Plan will then be able to use Gitpod as if they had purchased their own Professional or Unleashed plan.

Once the payment process is complete, you can manage team members, add more team seats, and also invite team members using a unique public URL.

You can either directly assign a seat by entering your team member's GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket username, or use the `Invite Members` link from the more actions button to get a shareable link. Send the link to your team so they can claim a seat.

## Good to know

- You won't be assigned to a seat in your new team plan when it is first created. Add yourself just like other members.
- If you add seats in the middle of a monthly billing period, you will be charged for the whole period.
